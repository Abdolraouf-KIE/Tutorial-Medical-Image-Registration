# This is a tutorial for anyone who wants to learn Medical Image Registration

The tutorial is divided into four parts:
- Pre-Processing:
  - Intensity Normalization
  - Space Normalization
  - Brain Extraction
- Registration with Classical Methodologies:
  - ANTS
  - AIR
  - Demons(Diffeomorfic, Mutual Information )
  - DRAMMS
  - DROP
  - Dartel
  - FLIRT
  - FNIRT
- Registration with Deep Learning 
  -  Learning to use Autoencoders (Autoencoder (shallow), Deep Autoencoder and Convolutional Autoencoder)
- Interesting Platforms to Learn and use
